In the rapidly advancing landscape of technology, an array of computer-aided systems dedicated to disease identification has surfaced, placing a significant emphasis on achieving heightened accuracy. Our proposed methodology leverages the cutting-edge deep learning (DL) technique to orchestrate an automatic identification system for kidney stones, employing coronal Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT or CT) images.

The primary objective of our method is to achieve precise detection of kidney stones, prompting the utilization of image processing. Image processing, known for its capability to yield accurate results, serves as an automated technique for stone detection. In contrast to the conventional human-based methods employed by doctors for stone detection from Computed Tomography scans, our process is entirely automated. This automated approach holds notable advantages, including time efficiency and a reduction in the risk of errors inherent in manual assessments.

By seamlessly integrating deep learning principles into the identification process, our method not only represents a paradigm shift in the accuracy of stone detection but also aligns with the broader trend in technological advancements aimed at enhancing the efficiency and reliability of medical diagnostics.
